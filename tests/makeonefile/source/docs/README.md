# Test Documentation

This is a test markdown file for the makefileonefile.py test suite.

## Purpose

To demonstrate how the script handles Markdown files with:

- Lists
- Headers
- Code blocks

```python
def example():
    """Just an example function in a code block"""
    return "This is just for testing"
```

## Notes

The script should correctly include this file in the combined output unless
specifically excluded.
