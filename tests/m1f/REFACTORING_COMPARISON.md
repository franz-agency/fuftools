# test_large_file_handling Refactoring Comparison

## Before (Original Implementation)

```python
def test_large_file_handling(self):
    """Test processing of large files."""
    output_file = OUTPUT_DIR / "large_file_test.txt"

    # Create a temporary input paths file specifically for the large file test
    temp_input_file = OUTPUT_DIR / "temp_large_file_input.txt"
    with open(temp_input_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        # Use a path that's relative to the test directory
        f.write(f"../source/code/large_sample.txt")

    # Measure execution time for performance testing
    start_time = time.time()

    # Run with the temp input paths file
    run_m1f(
        [
            "--input-file",
            str(temp_input_file),
            "--output-file",
            str(output_file),
            "--force",
        ]
    )

    execution_time = time.time() - start_time

    # Verify large file was processed successfully
    assert output_file.exists(), "Output file not created"
    assert output_file.stat().st_size > 0, "Output file is empty"

    # Log performance information
    print(f"Large file processing time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds")

    # Basic verification of content
    with open(output_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        content = f.read()
        assert "Large Sample Text File" in content, "File header missing"

        # Check for code patterns that would indicate the file was processed correctly
        assert (
            "This is a large sample text file" in content
        ), "File description missing"
        assert (
            "Generate a large amount of text content" in content
        ), "Content generation comment missing"

        # Check for the long string of 'a' characters (checking for at least 100 consecutive 'a's)
        # We don't check for the exact 3000 characters as the content might be truncated in display
        assert "a" * 100 in content, "Long string of 'a' characters is missing"
```

### Issues with Original:
- Single monolithic test mixing multiple concerns
- Hard-coded test data path
- Performance measurement mixed with functional testing
- Limited test coverage (only tests one scenario)
- No proper test data management
- Basic assertions that don't thoroughly verify behavior

## After (Refactored Implementation)

```python
class TestLargeFileHandlingRefactored:
    """Refactored test cases for large file handling in m1f.py."""
    
    # Test constants
    LARGE_FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB threshold for "large" files
    EXPECTED_PATTERNS = {
        "header": "Large Sample Text File",
        "description": "This is a large sample text file",
        "content_generation": "Generate a large amount of text content",
        "long_string": "a" * 100,  # Check for at least 100 consecutive 'a's
    }
    
    def test_large_file_basic_processing(self):
        """Test basic processing of a large file."""
        large_file_path = SOURCE_DIR / "code" / "large_sample.txt"
        output_file = OUTPUT_DIR / "test_large_basic.txt"
        
        execution_time = self._run_m1f_with_input_file(large_file_path, output_file)
        self._verify_file_content(output_file, self.EXPECTED_PATTERNS)
        
        print(f"\nLarge file processing time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds")
        
    def test_large_file_size_handling(self):
        """Test handling of files of various sizes."""
        test_sizes = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]  # MB
        
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
            temp_path = Path(temp_dir)
            
            for size_mb in test_sizes:
                test_file = temp_path / f"test_{size_mb}mb.txt"
                self._create_large_test_file(test_file, size_mb)
                
                output_file = OUTPUT_DIR / f"test_large_{size_mb}mb.txt"
                execution_time = self._run_m1f_with_input_file(test_file, output_file)
                
                assert output_file.exists(), f"Output file for {size_mb}MB not created"
                assert output_file.stat().st_size > 0, f"Output file for {size_mb}MB is empty"
                
                output_size_mb = output_file.stat().st_size / (1024 * 1024)
                assert output_size_mb >= size_mb * 0.9, f"Output file seems too small"
                
    def test_large_file_performance_baseline(self):
        """Establish a performance baseline for large file processing."""
        # Separate test dedicated to performance measurement
        # ... (implementation shown in full refactored file)
        
    def test_large_file_memory_efficiency(self):
        """Test that large files are processed efficiently."""
        # Tests memory-efficient processing with very large files
        # ... (implementation shown in full refactored file)
        
    def test_large_file_content_integrity(self):
        """Test that large file content is preserved correctly."""
        # Verifies content integrity with known patterns
        # ... (implementation shown in full refactored file)
```

### Improvements in Refactored Version:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each test method has a single, clear purpose
   - Performance testing separated from functional testing

2. **Better Test Coverage**
   - Multiple test scenarios (different file sizes, encodings, etc.)
   - Memory efficiency testing
   - Content integrity verification

3. **Improved Infrastructure**
   - Helper methods reduce code duplication
   - Proper test data management with temporary files
   - Configurable test parameters

4. **Enhanced Assertions**
   - More specific and meaningful assertions
   - Better error messages for debugging
   - Verification of multiple aspects of file processing

5. **Maintainability**
   - Clear test structure
   - Reusable components
   - Easy to extend with new test cases

## Key Refactoring Patterns Applied

1. **Extract Method**: Common functionality moved to helper methods
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each test focuses on one aspect
3. **Test Data Builder**: Dynamic test file creation
4. **Assertion Extraction**: Common assertions moved to verification methods
5. **Resource Management**: Proper use of temporary directories and cleanup

## Migration Path

1. First fix the duplication issue in the original test file
2. Replace the single test with the refactored test class
3. Run both old and new tests to ensure compatibility
4. Gradually migrate other tests using similar patterns
