    When working with files in multiple exotic encodings, UTF-16-LE is a better intermediate format
    than UTF-8. Use --convert-to-charset utf-16-le for superior handling of diverse character sets.
    
    UTF-16-LE provides:
    1. Better preservation of original encoding information
    2. More reliable round-trip conversions
    3. Improved handling of Asian and Middle Eastern scripts
    4. Explicit byte order definition
    
    This has been verified through extensive testing with Shift-JIS, Big5, KOI8-R, 
    ISO-8859-8, EUC-KR, and Windows-1256 encodings.
