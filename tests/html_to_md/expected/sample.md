# HTML to Markdown Conversion Example

This is a sample HTML document that demonstrates various HTML elements and how
they are converted to Markdown.

## Text Formatting

Here are some examples of **bold text**, _italic text_, and `inline code`.

You can also use [links to external websites](https://example.com) or
[links to other pages](another-page.md).

## Lists

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with _formatted text_

### Ordered List

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step with [a link](details.md)

## Code Blocks

Here's a code block with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    return True

# Call the function
result = hello_world()
```

And here's a code block with another language:

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Calculate 5 + 10
const result = calculateSum(5, 10);
console.log(`The sum is: ${result}`);
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote with a single paragraph.

> This is a blockquote with multiple paragraphs.
>
> Here's the second paragraph within the same blockquote.
>
> _You can use formatting_ inside blockquotes too.

## Tables

| Name   | Description           | Value |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----- |
| Item 1 | Description of item 1 | 100   |
| Item 2 | Description of item 2 | 200   |
| Item 3 | Description of item 3 | 300   |
