## [2.1.0] - 2024-12-19

### üéØ Major Refactoring and Code Quality Improvements

This release focuses on significant code quality improvements, performance optimizations, and maintainability enhancements while preserving all existing functionality.

#### ‚ú® Added
- New modular separator generation functions for better code organization
- Helper functions for path extraction and processing
- Unified path list writing functionality
- Better error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Enhanced encoding name normalization

#### üîß Changed
- **BREAKING DOWN MONOLITHIC FUNCTIONS**: Split massive 236-line `get_file_separator()` into focused, single-purpose functions:
  - `_gather_file_metadata()` - Extract common file metadata
  - `_create_standard_separator()` - Generate Standard style separators
  - `_create_detailed_separator()` - Generate Detailed style separators  
  - `_create_markdown_separator()` - Generate Markdown style separators
  - `_create_machine_readable_separator()` - Generate MachineReadable style separators
  - `_normalize_encoding_name()` - Consistent encoding name handling

- **CONSOLIDATED DUPLICATE CODE**: Unified `_write_file_paths_list()` and `_write_directory_paths_list()` into:
  - `_extract_paths_from_files()` - Common path extraction logic
  - `_write_paths_list()` - Generic path list writer with type parameter
  - Maintained backward compatibility with wrapper functions

- **ELIMINATED REDUNDANT FILE OPERATIONS**: 
  - Modified `get_file_separator()` to accept pre-read file content
  - Updated `_calculate_file_checksum()` to work on content strings instead of file paths
  - Reduced file I/O operations significantly for better performance

- **SIMPLIFIED ARGUMENT PARSER**: Streamlined `CustomArgumentParser` from 200+ lines to clean, maintainable code:
  - Removed complex formatting logic
  - Simplified error messages with optional color support
  - Better user experience with clearer error output

- **STREAMLINED ARGUMENT PROCESSING**: 
  - Created `normalize_extensions()` helper function
  - Simplified extension validation logic
  - Used safer `getattr()` calls for attribute access
  - Reduced code duplication in argument handling

#### üóëÔ∏è Removed
- Overly complex argument parser formatting logic (200+ lines)
- Redundant debug logging statements
- Unused commented-out argument parsing code
- Redundant suppressed arguments
- Dead code and unnecessary complexity

#### üêõ Fixed
- Fixed problematic walrus operator usage that caused syntax errors
- Improved error handling with proper exception management
- Better handling of missing attributes with safe `getattr()` usage
- Fixed potential issues with argument validation

#### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **Reduced I/O Operations**: Files now read once instead of multiple times for checksums
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better data structures and improved data flow
- **CPU Efficiency**: Eliminated redundant computations and file operations
- **Startup Time**: Removed complex initialization logic

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between metadata gathering, formatting, and file operations
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Smaller, focused functions following Single Responsibility Principle
- **Improved Testability**: Isolated concerns make unit testing much easier
- **Cleaner Interfaces**: Better function signatures and parameter passing

#### üìä Code Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: Reduced from 3,830 to 3,577 lines (-253 lines, -6.6%)
- **Function Complexity**: Significantly reduced with smaller, focused functions
- **Code Duplication**: Eliminated redundant patterns and consolidated similar logic
- **Maintainability Index**: Substantially improved through modular design

#### üîÑ Migration Notes
- All existing functionality preserved - no breaking changes to user-facing features
- Internal API changes are transparent to end users
- Command-line interface remains exactly the same
- All configuration options and features work as before

#### üéØ Benefits for Developers
- **Easier Debugging**: Smaller functions with clear, single responsibilities
- **Better Code Navigation**: Self-documenting function names and logical organization
- **Reduced Risk**: Modular design minimizes impact of changes
- **Faster Development**: Cleaner architecture enables quicker feature additions

### Technical Details

#### Refactored Functions
- `get_file_separator()`: Split into 5 focused functions
- `_write_file_paths_list()` & `_write_directory_paths_list()`: Unified into generic `_write_paths_list()`
- `CustomArgumentParser`: Simplified from complex formatter to clean error handler
- `_calculate_file_checksum()`: Optimized to work on content strings

#### Performance Optimizations
- Eliminated multiple file reads for checksum calculation
- Reduced memory allocations through better data flow
- Optimized string operations and path handling
- Streamlined argument processing pipeline

#### Code Quality Improvements
- Applied DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle throughout
- Enhanced function naming for better self-documentation
- Improved error handling and edge case management
- Better adherence to Python best practices and conventions
